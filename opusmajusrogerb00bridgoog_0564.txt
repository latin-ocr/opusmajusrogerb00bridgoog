552 ’ MULTIPLICATIO SPECIERUM

post eclipses stellarum accidit; nam primo debilitatam habent
lucem, tanquam similem et speciem, et post hoc claram et
completam. Cujus signum est quod luna videtur in eclipsi
rubea, et quod exit in umbra3 et quando est in umbra habet
speciem lucis debitae quae venit de luce transeunte per latera
et fines umbrae. sicut postea ¹ magis explanabitur.

Veruntamen sciendum quod species solis quae est de vera
ejus substantia non potest compleri in luna et stellis, licet in
eis fiat: quia tunc oporteret lumen et stellas fieri solem, quod
est impossibile. Lux enim est quantitas communis soli et
stellis et igni, licet magis sit in sole3 et ideo potest species
lucis compleri ira luna et stellis, et non species similis soli;
quia sol et luna et stellae durant in sua substantia, sicut
posterioribus erit manifestum. Et lux non est de eorum
substantia, sed est aeris communis eis et igni ; lieet aliquando
solebant dicere lucem esse formam substantialem solis et
stellarum. Sed hoc est falsum ².

¹ Cf, pp. roa-5 of this volume. lt is probable, however-..that the refemace
here, and a few lines lower down, ia to ι subsequent section of the work, of
which the present treatise is but a portion. ⁰

- ² 'The treatise here ends with the words ‘ Explicit tractatus fratris R. Bato-m
de* multiplicatione specierum· ln another and more recent handwriting the
words are added. ⁸ Post istum tractatum sequi debet perspectiva! 'nze fact that
this treatise was sent to the Pope at the same time as the Opus majus accounts
for its having been incorporated into that work by the transcribet of 0. (followed
by D. ).> Though there are references in it, like that on p. 408, which imply
that it was a portion of an encyclopaedic treatise‚ partly written, partly projected,
yet there are other references, like that on p. 534, to the Opus Hujus itself.
These 1 incline to regn-d as glosses, added perhaps by Bacon's pupils or
transcribere.

The scholastic style of the work conti-asts strongly with that of the opus
uvamwhieh. as we know, was a Peos-mco Pmambqln. lt has been less
studied than Bacon’a other works, not so much from its difficulty as from the
notion that it was a mere recen of Aristotelian Physica, and Ῑωιιι the further
notion that, Aristotelian Physics were not worth studying. Both of these
positione, 1 venture to think, will-be abandoned. when the ame attention shall
have been given to the history of sciente that has been given during the laat
half century to other departments of Evolution. What lin· Bacon'a discussions
upon force to a higher level than that of barren dialectioal debete is, that they
were animated by constant reference toa living and growing scienee due tqthe
later Greeks, 'and still more to the Arabiam, the science of Optio, including the
study of the organa of vision and perception no less than that of the force acting on
them. For Bacon the radiation of light was a type of all other radiant forces.
